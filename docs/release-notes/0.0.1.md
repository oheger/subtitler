Subtitler 0.0.1
===============

This is the initial release of the _Subtitler_ application. It contains a straight-forward implementation of the target use case:

* Audio input can be captured from an input device.
* Speech recognition is performed on the audio data.
* The resulting text (the _subtitles_) are shown in the UI.
* There is also a UI to configure the speech recognition process and the display of subtitles.

So, regarding the defined main use case, the application can be considered feature-complete. Of course, there is still much room for UX improvements and further useful features to be added.
